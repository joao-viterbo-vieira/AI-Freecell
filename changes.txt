Implementation and E2E Testing of Empty-to-Empty Moves

Implementation and end-to-end testing of a feature allowing activation or deactivation of 
empty-to-empty cascade moves for algorithm testing purposes. When enabled, this feature 
eliminates unnecessary moves between empty cascades.

Results:
• Significantly reduces the number of moves for the 12-card problem (e.g., 12-
  game2.txt) in both DFS and IDS algorithms
• Primarily beneficial in small game setups
• Full results available in README.md, appendix slide 29, and the Excel spreadsheet

Implementation and Testing of New Meta-Heuristic

A new multi-factor scoring system was implemented with the following design:
• Rewards cards in foundations (-10 points per card)
• Penalizes occupied free cells (+5 points per cell)
• Penalizes unordered cards in cascades (+1 point per disorder)

Results of Meta-Heuristic 2:
• Very effective for easy setups: fastest on average, with solutions surpassing A* 
  Heuristic 3 yet still below A* Heuristic 2
• Better than Meta-Heuristic 1 on hard setups, solving 2 of 4 challenging deals
• Low time and memory consumption for solved cases, though did not successfully 
  solve all hard cases

Additional Important Improvements

• Created detailed video tutorial/demo of the entire program with voice narration (New_Demo.mp4)
• Enhanced README.md with detailed description of algorithm results in section 6 
  (AI algorithms) and implementation of empty-to-empty moves removal
• Updated presentation slides with new information (slide 17 – metaheuristic2, slide 11 
  E2E optimization and appendix slides 27, 28, 29)
• Made minor improvements to the user interface
• Updated Results_Freecell_algorithms.xlsx with new results
